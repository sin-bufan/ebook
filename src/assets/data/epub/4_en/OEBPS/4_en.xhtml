			<p class="英文正文">At present, China&apos;s economic development has entered a new normal stage. In order to achieve better quality and higher efficiency, it is necessary to find an accurate positioning for arable land protection. In the new normal, we should make full use of and carefully protect the limited arable land resources, improve the quality, and continuously enhance the comprehensive productivity to stabilize grain production and ensure the food safety of the country. In 2008, the State Council issued the <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">Overall National Land Use Planning (2006-2020)</span>. Focusing on the red-line of minimum area of arable land, it identified targets of arable land protection and tasks of basic farmland protection and required governments at all levels to take measures to strictly control the loss of arable land, strengthen arable land quality construction, improve the comprehensive agricultural productivity, and safeguard the national food security. In February 2014, the Ministry of Land and Resources issued the <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">Circular on Enhancing Control on the Implementation of the Most Stringent Arable Land Protection System</span>. It demanded that governments at all levels make arable land protection their top priority in land management and ensure the stability of actual area of arable land, setting new and higher requirements on the protection of arable land in terms of both quantity and quality. In 2015, China published a No. 1 Central Document, <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">Opinions on Enhancing Reform and Innovation and Accelerating Agriculture Modernization Construction</span>, which further emphasized the protection of arable land and put forward a series of tasks including the designation of permanent basic farmland, high-quality farmland development, and so on. In April 2015, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued the <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">Opinions on Accelerating the Ecological Civilization Construction</span>. It included arable land protection as an important aspect of ecological civilization construction, emphasized the ecological protection of farmland, and decided to implement arable land quality protection and upgrading trend.</p>
			<p class="英文正文">In 2014, the area of arable land in China consisted in 135.0573 million hectares, including 10,200 hectares of basic farmland set in the year. In 2015, the arable land recorded a reduction of 301,700 hectares which were used for construction, destroyed by natural hazards, returned to ecological preservation land, and reduced due to agricultural restructuring. Nevertheless, 242,200 hectares of arable land were newly added by land upgrading and reclamation and agricultural restructuring in the same period. The annual net reduction of arable land was 59,500 hectares (Figure 1-2).</p>

The first reason for area reduction was construction, and then agricultural restructuring. Percentage of land area used for construction in the total reduction of arable land had increased from 78.7% in 2011 to 86.1% in 2014, yet it dropped slightly in 2015. Meanwhile, the percentage of reduction due to agricultural restructuring in the total reduction had decreased year on year from 13.5% in 2011 to 8.7% in 2015 (Figure 1-3).  </p>

The year 2015 marked an apparent drop of arable land reduction in central and western regions. As for different provinces, 15 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government) in the country witnessed an increase of their arable land area, with the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region recording the greatest net increase at 19,400 hectares (Figure 1-4).</p>

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Land and Resources has cooperated with the Ministry of Finance in the allocation of land compensation fees for new construction land to support relevant work of local government (Figure 1-5). In 2015, 9,918 land consolidation projects of different types have been completed in the country.163,100 hectares of arable land were newly added, marking a year-on-year increase of 19.1%. The total area of construction projects covered 1.6903 million hectares, in which 91.20% was used for land upgrading, 0.01% was used for land reclamation, and 0.08% was used for new development. Land upgrading was the maintype of projects in provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government) in the eastern and central regions,and new development of land was the main type in the western region. The total investment of construction projects reached RMB 36.159 billion, a year-on-year increase of 16.70% (Figure 1-6).</p>

			<p class="英文正文">With the transformation of the economic growth model during the period of the 12th Five-Year Plan in China, the supply of land for construction also shifted from the pursuit of external expansion to development of the internal potential; it also transitioned from anextensive low efficient mode to the intensive high efficient pattern. Further optimization of land supply structure has guaranteed an adequate land supply for the need of fast industrialization and urbanization and promoted the transformation and upgrading of economy and regionally coordinated development. In March 2015, the Ministry of Land and Resources and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development jointly issued the <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">Circular on Optimization of Housing and Land Supply Structure in 2015 to Promote the Stable and Sound Development of Real Estate Market</span>. It clarified the policy of current land use for real estate development and indemnificatory apartment projects based on the principle of reasonably setting the size and structure of land supply for housing and ensuring adequate land use for indemnificatory apartment projects. In December 2015, the Ministry of Land and Resources, together with four other ministries including the National Development and Reform Commission, issued the <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">Opinions on Land Use Policy Supporting the Development of New Industry and New Types of Business to Promote Popular Entrepreneurship and Innovation</span>. This document was put forward to ensure adequate land supply for new businesses through promoting differentiated land supply policies to support the development of new types of businesses, revitalizethe utilization of existing land, and guide the clusterization of new industries in development. </p>
			<p class="英文正文">In 2015, the supply of state-owned land for construction was 540,300 hectares, a year-on-year fall of 16.6%. As for the mode of land supply, the area of land supplied by allocation, assignment, leasing, and other modes was 314,500 hectares, 224,900 hectares, 800 hectares, and 667,000 hectares, respectively. As compared to the previous year, these mode categories have dropped by 15.0%, 18.9%, and increased by 3.0% and 28 times, respectively. They accounted for 58.21%, 41.62%, 0.16%, and 0.01% of the total amount of land supply, respectively. As for the types of land supply, the area of land for industrial, mining, and warehouse use was 127,300 hectares, and that for commercial and business facilities, residential use, and other uses was 36,900 hectares, 83,800 hectares, and 292,300 hectares, respectively.

			<p class="英文正文">Economical and intensive use of land is the fundamental strategy of the ecological civilization construction and the strategic choice for a new-type urbanization. In recent years, China has taken a series of measures on the land use to promote economical and intensive use of land, and made active progress in this area. In 2014, the Ministry of Land and Resources issued the <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">Guiding Opinions on Promoting Economical and Intensive Use of Land</span>. Focusing on the characteristics of the current stage of the &quot;new normal&quot; of development, in which China should also simultaneously deal with a slow down in economic growth, difficult structural adjustments, and the effects of the previous economic stimulus policies, the document put forward new requirements on forcefully promoting economical and intensive use of land. The Ministry of Land and Resources considered and approved the <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">Provisions on Economical and Intensive Use of Land</span> in March 2014 and issued the <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">National Regulations on Organization and Implementation of Evaluation on Economical and Intensive Use of Urban Construction Land </span>in 2015. All these have contributed to the establishment of a comprehensive system to provide guidance for different behaviors and activities to implement economical and intensive use of land, realize reduction of land use, enhance the intensity of land use, optimize the structure and layout of land use, and improve the efficiency of land use. However, the current level of market-oriented allocation of land resources in China is still low and such phenomena as low efficiency utilization and unused land for construction can still be found.  </p>
			<p class="英文正文">As for the land use efficiency, the unit construction land total output value in the country was RMB 1.25 billion/10,000 mu (mu≈0.067 hectares) in 2015, up by 4.4% over 2014. The land use efficiency has increased slightly. As for different regions in the country, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province, Tibet Autonomous Region, and Gansu Province were comparatively lower in unit land output value, while Gansu Province experienced a significant decrease, down by 2.1% over the previous year. Shanghai Municipality, Beijing Municipality, Tianjin Municipality, Zhejiang Province, and Guangdong Province were comparatively higher in terms of unit land output value. Chongqing Municipality and Beijing Municipality have experienced a significant increase, up by 8.6% and 7.2% over the previous year, respectively. The unit construction land output value in the eastern, central, and western regions was RMB 1.326 billion/10,000 mu, RMB 1.283 billion/10,000 mu, and RMB 1.129 billion/10,000 mu, up by 5.0%, 4.1%, and 4.2% over the previous year, respectively. Thus, the eastern region has experienced an apparent increase in unit land output value and most of the provinces that saw asignificant increase in unit land output value were located in this region. </p>
			<p class="英文正文">From the perspective of investment on land development, the investment on fixed assets per unit construction land in the country was RMB 0.94 billion/10,000 mu, up by 9.4% over the previous year. As for the regional distribution, the unit land investment in Tianjin Municipality, Fujian Province, and Chongqing Municipality was comparatively high at RMB 2.11 billion/10,000 mu, RMB 1.76 billion/10,000 mu, and RMB 1.56 billion/10,000 mu, respectively. Heilongjiang Province (RMB 0.42 billion/10,000 mu) and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (RMB 0.45 billion/10,000 mu) were comparatively low in terms of unit land investment. Compared to 2014, all provinces have increased the irinvestment. Tianjin Municipality and Tibet Autonomous Region have experienced a comparatively significant increase of 23.5% and 22.4% over the previous year, respectively. The unit land investment of the eastern, central, and western regions was RMB 0.93 billion/10,000 mu, RMB 1.03 billion/10,000 mu, and RMB 0.85 billion/10,000 mu,respectively. Therefore, the unit land investment was highest in the central region, while the investment in the eastern region and some provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government) of the western region has also increased significantly. </p>
			<p class="英文正文">Currently, the unit land output is higher than unit land investment in the whole country.The investment and output differences are positive in 22 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government). The investment and output differences in Shanghai Municipality, Beijing Municipality, and Guangdong Province are comparatively high at RMB 4.04 billion/10,000 mu, RMB 2.80 billion/10,000 mu, and RMB 1.73 billion/10,000 mu, respectively, while those in Qinghai, Tibet, Sichuan, Gansu, Hunan, Ningxia, and Shaanxi provinces (autonomous regions) are comparatively low. As for the investment-output growth, unit land output growth is generally lower than investment growth. The difference between unit output growth and investment growth in the whole country is -2.1%. Liaoning Province (28.9%), Guangdong Province (27.3%), and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (22.6%) have a comparatively high difference between output growth and investment growth. It can be seen that the unit land investment on land for construction has maintained sustainable growth. The development of the eastern region is more mature, with the best land use efficiency. The central region is intensive in development, yet the efficiency of land use has not been fully achieved. The land use efficiency in the western region is to be improved (Figure 1-13).</p>

			<p class="英文正文">Mine reclamation refers to the planned renovation of land damaged by digging, collapse and pressure during mine construction and production, etc., in order to restore it to a usable status. In the process of mining, destruction of local ecological balance is the main source of mining-induced environmental problems. Ecological restoration work of mine waste land in China began in late 1970s and early 1980s. With the development of the national economy and the increasing demands of environmental protection, mine reclamation is the main way to solve mining-induced environmental problems and mine economic development at the present stage. Table 6-1 shows the situation of an area of land damaged by mining and receiving recovery and control in recent years. It can be seen from Table 6-1 that, in recent years, newly added land occupied and damaged by mining exhibited a decreasing trend, despite the fluctuations, while the proportion of cumulative area recovered and controlled in the total cumulative land area occupied and damaged exhibited a general increasing trend rise, despite the fluctuations. As of the end of 2014, cumulative mine area recovered and controlled accounted for 20.83% of the cumulative land area occupied and damaged.</p>

			<p class="英文正文">During the 12th Five-Year Plan, the Provisional Measures on the Management of Surveying and Mapping of Foreign Organizations or Persons in China have been amended, and many measures issued by the related departments, including the <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">Measures for the Administration of Administrative Law Enforcement Certificates for Geographic Information Surveying and Mapping</span> have been put into practice in succession; a series of important regulated documents, including the <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">Provisional Regulations of the Certified Surveyor and Cartographer System, Measures on the Management of the Basic Surveying and Mapping Plan, the Provisional Regulations on the Management of the Practice of the Basic Surveying and Mapping Results, the Measures on the Management of the Public Usage of the Remote-Sensing Image (Trial)</span>, and the <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">Regulations on the Public Maps’ Contents and Images</span>, have been issued. A legal system of surveying and mapping of geo-information has been set up, and together with the advancement of the local legislation, has laid a solid legal foundation for the development of the industry.</p>
			<p class="英文正文">The Five-Year Plan was adopted on the 2015’s Working Conference on Legislative Affairs, which accelerated the legal administration work. The amendment (draft) of the <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">Law of Surveying and Mapping of the People’s Republic of China</span> has been submitted to the State Council. A legislative investigation has also been carried out by the NPC Environmental and Resources Protection Committee and the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council of the China. The publication and implementation of the <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">Regulations of the Administration of Maps</span> demonstrated the awareness toward the national territory, further perfected the approving procedures of maps, canceled the division of authority in matters of map publication, emphasized the protection of personal positioning information, enhanced the supervision of the concurrent and feedback contents, completed the legal responsibilities, and strongly enforced the state sovereignty, security and interests.</p>
			<p class="英文正文">The legislation work in Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Qinghai, and Sichuan has made new progress: reform in administrative approval system was promoted, all the related intermediary services were removed, a negative access list was proposed, the “one stop approval” for all affairs was achieved, and a series of approval projects were cancelled and decentralized.</p>
			<p class="英文正文">Through the amendment of the <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">Regulations on Management of Surveying and Mapping Qualification and Grading Standard of Surveying and Mapping Qualification</span>, the approving procedures will be optimized, the administrative authority will be decentralized, the entry barrier will be lowered, and the supervision on the concurrent and feedback contents will be emphasized. A qualification inspection has already been implemented, a credit constraint mechanism has been set up, and the joint enforcement of the law was promoted. At the same time, the release of the annual report on surveying and mapping qualification ensures a process of social supervision, with the annual reports on surveying and mapping qualification being submitted online by the surveying and mapping departments, as well as the release of these reports on the responsible departments’ websites.  </p>
			<p class="英文正文">The directive of strengthening the construction and management of the satellite navigation positioning base stations issued by Central government has been carried out, and the investigation of the satellite navigation positioning base stations has been completed. A national Internet map monitoring network has been set up, which realized the quick discovery, divisional judgment and collaboration of geo-information on the Internet by the surveying points at both the national and provincial levels. Inspection of the national geo-information security system has been carried out according to the law. Educational auxiliary maps and historical maps have been checked, and nearly 1000 companies and units have been asked to rectify and improve their work. The Awareness Day for Surveying and Mapping Law and the “Into the Media” activity of awareness and education on the national territory have effectively helped maintain the integrity of national geo-information and the dignity of the national territory.</p>
			<p class="英文正文">In 2015, the responsible authority departments of surveying and mapping at various levels had made 7,279 inspections related to law enforcement.

			<p class="英文正文">The First National Geographic Conditions Survey has entered its final stage. It has completed the data production of the complete, seamless and high-precision national geo-information census on land in China. The survey carried out the checking of the standard census time-points, built a database, and grasped the basic geo-information situation in the country. Following the principle of “probing, monitoring and implementing at the same time,” a monitoring production organization and technological system for national geo-information was first set up, the National Technology Support Project “National Geo-information Monitoring and Application System” has been completed, and a series of monitoring results have been achieved, including in the integrative development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area, the management of Sanjiangyuan ecological protection area, monitoring of the changes in coastal tidal flat, geographic and environmental changes in Three Gorges, and changes in the construction of national-level new areas. All these have played a vital role in the work of supporting science-based governmental decisions, the construction of an ecological civilization, the “multiple rules integration,” the trial audit of natural resources and property for outgoing leading officials, the fight against terrorism and maintaining stability.</p>
			<p class="英文正文">More than 50 thousand census workers are involved in the 3-year-long First National Geographic Conditions Survey in China. This census is an expansion of the contents available based on the present surveying and mapping geo-information. For the sampling elements of farms, woods, yards, grasslands, reservoirs (ponds), and individual premises, the smallest sample area is 400 m<span class="CharOverride-1">2</span>; for the sampling elements of greening woods, greening grasslands, and individual premises in urban areas, the smallest sample area is 200 m<span class="CharOverride-1">2</span>. Through this census, we can not only grasp the basic situation of the natural resources on the terrain surface, such as mountains, water, woods, farms, lakes, including the classification, position, coverage and area of the farms, gardens, grasslands, lakes, rivers, reservoirs (ponds), deserts and bare terrain surfaces, glaciers and long-persistent snowing areas, but we can also have a clear understanding of the classification, position, length, area and spatial distribution of human activity-related human geography factors, such as the traffic network, residential places and facilities, geographical units.</p>

			<p class="英文正文">Geo-information industry is a fast developing new industry. With its rapid developing speed, the geo-information industry has not only played an apparent role in national informatization and modernization, but also contributed a lot to economic growth and social stability. In recent years, ministries of Land and Resources, Transportation, Water Conservancy, Railway, Civil Sffairs, Agriculture, Construction, Environmental protection and Forestry have set up their own related geo-information database and application system. The Ministry of Land and Resources, for example, has built digital geographic maps with ratios of 1:500,000, 1:200,000, and 1:50,000, digital hydrogeologic maps with ratios of 1:6,000,000 and 1:200,000, and other spatial database. The land-use planning databases at the national, provincial and key city levels and the national 1:500,000 land-use database can be used to manage geo-information in China. The Ministry of Agriculture has set up a national 1:1,000,000 grassland resources database, a fishery resources database in the country&apos;s maritime exclusive economic area, and a geo-information service system for agricultural resources. The Ministry of Forestry also has completed a geo-information database for forestry and can generate various information products through comprehensive analysis. Geo-information has become an important source of information for Internet users, cell-phone users and vehicle users, becoming a part of the public&apos;s daily life. Users can locate their position, find a transportation mean and navigate through the geo-information system.</p>
			<p class="英文正文">With the development of geo-information, new applications and new services have emerged and continue to do so. Internet searching engine providers, e-commerce providers, communication service providers, and vehicle producers have all entered the geo-information-related area. As a result, new economic growth hotspots have appeared in areas such as remote-sensing, navigation and positioning and position service. With this diversification and the establishment of a business-led mode, the geo-information industry can expect an era of pluralistic and deep application, which will require the continuous improving of the core competences of related enterprises.</p>
			<p class="英文正文">After the release and implementation of the <span class="times斜体 _idGenCharOverride-1">Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of the Geographic Information Industry</span>, 22 provincial governments have issued correspondent policies. Measures such as constructing an industrial development platform, easing market access, opening the data, fostering projects and regulating the market are taken to promote the development of the industry. In provinces such as Zhejiang, Sichuan, Shandong, Jiangsu and Hunan, the agglomeration effect of industrial parks has been proven effective. Zhongdixin Geo-information Private Equity Fund has been put into practice, and Smart Sichuan Industrial Investment Fund has been set up, while Zhejiang introduced Venture Capital and Credit expansion to push the development of this industry. The project of “100 cities, 100 connections, 100 uses” (i.e., the positioning and navigation of locations in 100 Chinese cities through Internet) has made significant achievements. The creative space “Dixin Dream Factory,” which deals with national geo-information, was established in Zhejiang. Some companies have set up their own “Double Innovation Center” voluntarily. Due to the rise of new geo-information applications, related industries began to transform and upgrade. The geo-information Industry has maintained an annual developing speed of 25%.</p>
			<p class="英文正文">At the end of 2015, there were 15,900 qualified surveying and mapping units in China, an  increase of 9.8 year-on-year. The total value of services provided by qualified surveying and mapping units was RMB 83.705 billion, a 23.1% year-on-year growth. During the 12th Five-Year Plan, the total value of services provided by the national qualified surveying and mapping units was RMB 313.099 billion. (Figure 8-1)</p>

			<p class="英文正文">The first phase of the construction of a national benchmark system on modern surveying and mapping has been completed. A national network of 1,879 station-scale satellite navigation positioning base stations has been set up, and the national satellite navigation positioning service system has been completed. The Beidou system base stations, which are developed independently by China, were built and achieved self-control of the national base service system. The basic geo-information databases with ratios of 1:50,000, 1:250,000, and 1:1,000,000 have completed their yearly update. The coverage for 1:10,000-ratio basic geo-information reached 5.6 million km<span class="CharOverride-1">2</span> in 23 provinces (cities); large scale basic geo-information data covered most urban area. We saw a significant increase in aerial image data. Images sent by the ZY-3 satellite covered a global area of 71.12 km<span class="CharOverride-1">2</span> effectively. Images sent by other satellites in different periods and resolution ratios covered an area of 28.1 million km<span class="CharOverride-1">2</span>. The basic aerial photographic images at both national and provincial levels covered an area of 62.6 million km<span class="CharOverride-1">2</span>. The covering data of the terrain surface is constantly updating, and the surveying and mapping items of polar region, pipelines and construction of new villages is following a steady development.

			<p class="英文正文">The geo-information public service platform “Map World” has collected 408 online databases through national, provincial and city (town) surveying points, integrated nearly 100 professional databases for statistics, travel and meteorology, and played an important role in contributing to the areas of national electronic government, disaster reduction and prevention, public security, safety supervision, customs, meteorology and others. City digitalization was promoted among all prefecture-level cities and 476 county-level cities with the application of more than 5,600 systems, and the construction of a trial Smart City has achieved initial achievements. The greatly improved emergency mapping ability provided strong guarantees for the emergency events such as the earthquakes in Pishan of Xinjiang, Nepal, and Tibet, the explosion in Binhai New District in Tianjin, and the landslides in Shanyang of Shaanxi, Lishui of Zhejiang, and Shenzhen of Guangdong. The emergency mapping ability also guaranteed the important strategies such as the “Belt and Road” Initiative, the integrative development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area, the Yangtze River Economic Zone, the key projects such as South-to-North Water Diversion, and the critical affairs such as “Military Parade on Sept. 3rd” and China&apos;s bid for the Winter Olympic Games in 2022.</p>
			<p class="英文正文">In 2015, the surveying and mapping geo-information system has provided 1.4153 million topographic maps of different scales, 281.79 TB of “4D” results and data, 114,800 points of surveying and mapping benchmark results, 239.78 TB of aerial photographic data, and 185.39 TB of satellite remote-sensing materials.</p>
